# 0x1D. C - Binary trees: Learning Objectives

In this project, I've learned a lot about binary trees and their various properties. By the end of this project, I can confidently explain the following concepts without needing to use Google:

## General
- I understand what a binary tree is and how it's structured.
- I can differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree.
- I know the potential advantages in terms of time complexity that binary trees offer compared to linked lists.
- I comprehend the terms depth, height, and size of a binary tree and how they relate to its structure.
- I am familiar with the different traversal methods used to navigate through a binary tree.
- I can define what a complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary tree are and understand their characteristics.

This project has provided me with a solid foundation in binary tree concepts, enabling me to work with these structures effectively in my coding tasks.
